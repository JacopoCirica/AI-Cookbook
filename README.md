# AI Cookbook üöÄ
The AI Cookbook is a collection of notebooks illustrating practical aspects of building AI applications and solving various machine learning tasks using open-source tools and models.

## Introduction

AI Engineering is advancing rapidly, and staying at the forefront requires both deep understanding and hands-on experience. 

## Context Engineering 

The section essentially describes, quoting Tobi Lutke, ‚Äúthe art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM.‚Äù, namely the set of techniques and methods that leverage the context window of an LLM. In this section, prompt engineering techniques or RAG-from the basics to the more advanced-are included, as well as evaluation and short/long memory strategies.

## LLM Fundamentals

This section is mainly to show how to implement the different components of the Transformer architecture

## Agents

Different techniques and approaches to building an agent, using different libraries or from scratch, will be presented here. It will start from the basics to recently developed protocols.

## LLM Recipes
